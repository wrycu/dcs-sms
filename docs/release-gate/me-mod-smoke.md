# ME-mod — manual smoke checklist

CI runs the parity + unit tests under `tools/me-mod/test/run-tests.ps1`. This checklist is the release-gate before tagging a `me-mod-v*` release; run by hand against a fresh DCS install.

For installation instructions and feature overview, see [`tools/me-mod/README.md`](../../tools/me-mod/README.md). This page is the release-gate procedure only.

## Setup

1. Run `tools/dcs-sms.exe install-me-mod`. Open the ME. Verify the top menu bar shows a **DCS-SMS** entry containing **Prefab Manager** and **About**. Verify the Prefab Manager window does NOT appear automatically.
2. Open **DCS-SMS → Prefab Manager**. Window appears with all panels (Save / Library / Action / Status).
3. Open **DCS-SMS → About**. Dialog appears centered with the Coconut Cockpit logo, version string, and project URLs. Close button dismisses it.

## SMSWindow + Prefab Manager refactor (added 0.5.0)

Verify the refactor preserved Prefab Manager behaviour exactly:

- [ ] Open ME with a fresh mission; click `DCS-SMS > Prefab Manager`. Window
      opens at top-right of screen, size matches pre-refactor (~720×460),
      title bar reads `Coconut Cockpit · DCS-SMS — Prefab Manager v0.5.0`.
- [ ] Drag a window edge to resize. Footer separator + status text stay
      glued to the bottom; grid stretches to fill the new content area.
- [ ] Drag a window edge inward past the minimum (~540 wide). Window
      snaps back to the minimum size.
- [ ] Click the close `[X]` in the title bar. Window hides; click the
      menu entry again — window reopens with state preserved (no widget
      reconstruction).
- [ ] In a fresh mission, save a prefab. Footer flashes green
      ("Saved <name>...") and reverts to empty after ~5s.
- [ ] Try to save with an empty name. Footer flashes yellow
      (warning); reverts after ~5s.
- [ ] Trigger an error (e.g. delete a file the mod is trying to open).
      Footer flashes red. Reverts after ~5s.
- [ ] Click "Place at click" on a saved prefab. Footer goes green and
      stays green ("PLACING ... CLICK ON MAP") until you click the map
      or press Escape — does NOT auto-revert.
- [ ] Press `Ctrl+Z` after placing a prefab. Last placement is undone
      and the footer flashes a green "Undo successful." message.
- [ ] Press `Ctrl+Z` with no placement to undo. Footer flashes a
      yellow "Nothing to undo." message.
- [ ] Click `File > New`. Prefab Manager auto-closes. Reopen via the
      menu — works.
- [ ] Click `File > Open` (load an existing mission). Prefab Manager
      auto-closes. Reopen via menu — works.
- [ ] `Ctrl+Shift+R` dev reload still works. Window closes, reload
      logged, window reopens with fresh code.

## Save flow

3. Place one A-10C in the ME. Select it. Type `test_jet` in the name field. Click **Save**. Verify file at `Saved Games\DCS\dcs-sms\prefabs\test_jet.lua` and the library refreshes to show it.
4. With nothing selected, click **Save** with name `empty`. Status: `No selection — nothing to save`. No file written.
5. With selection, click **Save** with name `test_jet` (collision). Modal appears with **Overwrite / Rename / Cancel**. Pick Cancel — no change. Pick Overwrite — file overwritten.
6. Multi-selection: select two groups + one trigger zone + one drawing. Save as `complex_test`. Open the saved file and verify all four sections are populated.

## Place flow — at click

7. Library shows `test_jet` sorted A-Z. Select it, set rotation 0, click **Place at click**. Verify the title bar text changes to `Click on map to place test_jet (Esc to cancel)` and the button text becomes `Cancel`.
8. Click somewhere on the map. Verify the A-10C appears at that location, status confirms placement, **Ctrl-Z** removes it (group disappears from the ME).
9. Re-place `test_jet`. Save the `.miz`, close the ME, reopen the `.miz`. Verify the placed group survived (no dcs-sms-specific state needed at runtime).
10. Place at click with rotation 90. Verify the group is rotated 90° from how it was saved.
11. Place at click then press **Esc**. Verify exit from place-pending, no entity injected.

## Place flow — at original

12. Save a prefab that includes a group near a specific map building. Click **Place at original location**. Verify it lands at the original `meta.world_anchor`, not at any clicked location.

## Best-effort partial-failure

13. Manually corrupt a prefab file to have one valid group + one group with a bogus DCS type. Place it. Verify status: `Placed N of M entities — see dcs.log`. The valid group is in the mission; the corrupt one is logged.

## Library

14. Save 3 prefabs with names `a`, `m`, `z`. Verify the grid is sorted A-Z and shows the documented columns (Name / Theatre / Fixed Pos / AB / G / S / Z / D).
15. Verify the **Theatre** column shows the current theatre name (e.g. `Caucasus`) for prefabs saved under this branch — *not* `?`.
16. Click a row. Verify it highlights and the status bar shows `Selected: <name>`. Click another. Selection moves.
17. Rename `m` to `middle`. Verify the file is renamed AND `meta.name` is updated inside (open the file).
18. Delete `middle`. Confirmation modal. Confirm. Verify file gone, list refreshed.
19. Manually drop a malformed `.lua` file into the prefabs dir. Click **Reload**. Verify it appears as a row with `[ERROR] <name>` in the Name column and a truncated error message in the Theatre column.

## Undo

20. Place a prefab. Press **Ctrl-Z** (window focused). Verify removal.
21. Press **Ctrl-Z** again. Status: `Nothing to undo.`
22. Place. Click somewhere outside the Prefab Manager window to remove its focus. Press **Ctrl-Z**. Verify nothing happens (window not focused — broad ME-wide undo is [issue #25](https://github.com/nielsvaes/dcs-sms/issues/25)).

## Dev reload

23. With the Prefab Manager window focused, press **Ctrl+Shift+R**. Verify the window briefly disappears and reopens (status bar shows `Ready.`). `dcs.log` should contain `dev reload triggered` → `cleared N modules from package.loaded` → `dev reload completed`. Subsequent edits to the mod's Lua files are picked up by another Ctrl+Shift+R, no DCS restart required.

## Cleanup

24. Run `tools/dcs-sms.exe uninstall-me-mod`. Verify everything removed (modules dir gone, `MissionEditor.lua` patch reverted from backup).

## Prefab Manager — folder browser + context menus

- [ ] Open Prefab Manager. Tree pane visible on the left; "+ New folder" button below the tree; "Search folders:" input above the tree.
- [ ] "Search files:" label (right of tree) renamed from "Search:".
- [ ] Click "+ New folder" with nothing selected → name prompt opens. Enter "CAP". Folder appears in tree at root level.
- [ ] Right-click "CAP" → menu shows New subfolder, Rename, Delete, Open in Explorer.
- [ ] Right-click "CAP" → New subfolder → "Tomcats". Nested folder appears.
- [ ] Select "CAP/Tomcats". Save a new prefab. Verify file lands in `<SavedGames>\DCS\dcs-sms\prefabs\CAP\Tomcats\<name>.prefab`.
- [ ] Click "Show all" button → selection clears (tree highlight gone), file pane shows all prefabs (root + nested) recursively.
- [ ] Click "CAP" parent → file pane shows prefabs from CAP and ALL its subfolders (recursive prefix match).
- [ ] Type "horn" in Search files while a folder is selected → narrows within folder.
- [ ] Type "horn" in Search files with no selection → matches across all folders.
- [ ] Type "tom" in Search folders → only tree nodes named or containing "Tom" are shown.
- [ ] Right-click a prefab row → menu shows Update Prefab with selection, Move to..., Rename, Delete, Copy file contents, Copy place snippet, Show in Explorer (separators after Update, after Delete, and before Show in Explorer). There are no longer Rename/Delete buttons in the row-3 action band — only Reload + Undo last placement remain there.
- [ ] Right-click → Rename → overlay prompts for a new name; renames the right-clicked prefab and the list refreshes.
- [ ] Right-click → Delete → confirm overlay names the right-clicked prefab; deleting removes it and the list refreshes.
- [ ] Click "Show in Explorer" → Windows Explorer opens with the file selected.
- [ ] Click "Copy file contents" → paste somewhere, content matches the `.prefab` file body. Status line: "Copied X.prefab contents (N bytes)."
- [ ] Click "Copy place snippet" → paste, snippet matches `sms.prefab.place("<name>", {x = 0, y = 0})  -- rotation = 0, country = nil`. Status notes sms.prefab.place not shipped yet.
- [ ] Right-click a row with an error → menu shows only Delete and Show in Explorer (Delete lets you clean up the broken file).
- [ ] Move to... opens modal; pick "SAM", click Move. Prefab now in SAM. File list and tree both refresh.
- [ ] Rename "CAP" → "Combat Air Patrol". Sub-folder "Tomcats" still inside it. Selection follows the rename.
- [ ] Delete a non-empty folder → confirmation overlay shows count. Cancel keeps it. Delete removes everything recursively.
- [ ] Folder name validation: try "CAP/x", "..", "CON" → all rejected with status message.
- [ ] Resize window → tree stays at 200 px wide; file grid widens.
- [ ] Reload (Ctrl+Shift+R) or close/re-open Prefab Manager → tree refreshes from disk.

## Mass Edit (v0.10.0+)

The Mass Edit window is being rebuilt around an action-panel model
(see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-18-me-mass-edit-rework-design.md`).
PR-by-PR each form is added; this section will grow as forms land.

### Right-pane scroll (v0.10.0+)

The right pane is wrapped in a ScrollPane so all stacked forms are
reachable regardless of window height.

- [ ] Open Mass Edit on Group tab at the default window height. Verify
      a scrollbar appears on the right pane and all 6 forms (Rename,
      Find & replace, Add prefix, Add suffix, Set country, Visibility &
      control) can be reached by scrolling.
- [ ] Switch to Unit tab, then back to Group. The right pane scroll
      position resets to top.
- [ ] A thin vertical splitter handle sits in the gutter between the
      tree pane and the form pane. Click + drag it left and right —
      the tree and form panes resize live, clamped between a usable
      minimum form width (~340) and a usable minimum tree width
      (~220). Releasing the mouse stops the drag. Resizing the whole
      window afterwards keeps the user's chosen split.
- [ ] Each consecutive pair of forms in the right pane is separated
      by a thin dark horizontal line with a small bit of vertical
      breathing room above and below. The line is hidden when the
      scope has 0 or 1 forms (e.g. Unit / Waypoint / Zone / Drawing).
- [ ] Resize the window taller until all 6 forms fit. The scrollbar
      disappears.
- [ ] Hide a form (e.g. via Ctrl+Shift+R reload while the window is
      open) and verify no empty gap is left in the scroll content area.
      (If gaps appear, hidden forms still contribute to the pane's
      content height — file as a follow-up.)

### Scope tab strip (v0.10.0+)

- [ ] **Scope tab strip:** Opening the Mass Edit window shows the five scope tabs (Group / Unit / Waypoint / Zone / Drawing) anchored to the left pane and equally sharing its width. The currently-mounted scope has a filled teal background and white text; the other four read as dim grey text on the panel background with no chrome. Clicking an inactive tab switches scope and the teal moves to the clicked tab; clicking the already-active tab does nothing visible.

### Airbase scope (v0.10.0+)

- [ ] **Airbase tab lists all airbases.** Clicking the Airbase scope tab populates the treeview with every map airfield in the mission, with columns Name / Coalition (tinted red/blue/yellow) / North / East. Sorting by clicking any column header works as on other scopes.
- [ ] **Marquee drag on F10 map bulk-checks.** With the Mass Edit window open (any scope), drag a rectangle on the F10 map covering several airbases. Switch to the Airbase scope — the airbases inside the rectangle are checked. Drawing a second rectangle UNIONS more airbases into the checked set rather than replacing.
- [ ] **Set Coalition form.** Pick a coalition in the combo, click Set — every checked airbase flips coalition; the F10 map color updates immediately. Undo (Ctrl+Z) restores prior per-airbase coalitions.
- [ ] **Export/Import warehouse.** Check exactly one airbase, type a name like "Cold War Loadout", click Save — file appears in `<Saved Games>\DCS\dcs-sms\airbase-warehouses\<name>.lua`. Check several other airbases, pick the saved entry in the Saved combo, click Apply — the loaded warehouse splats onto every checked airbase. Click Delete — the file is removed and the combo refreshes.

### Rename groups

- [ ] The Rename groups form is the topmost form in the Group scope's right pane.
- [ ] Hovering the Rename button shows a tooltip: `Use {n} for sequence, e.g. "Foo-{n}"`.
- [ ] Check 3 groups, type `X-{n}` in the Name field, click Rename. Names become `X-01`, `X-02`, `X-03` in name-ascending order (alphabetical by previous name, not by check order). Footer toast: `3 renamed`.
- [ ] Type `Foo` (no `{n}` token) and click Rename with the same 3 groups checked. All three get a name based on `Foo` — DCS auto-disambiguates the collision. Toast: `3 renamed`.
- [ ] Click Rename with the Name field empty. Toast: `Name is empty` (warning). No names mutate.
- [ ] Click Rename with nothing checked. Toast: `Nothing selected` (warning).
- [ ] Press `Ctrl+Z` while the window has focus. The most recent rename reverts.
- [ ] After a rename, the entity list refreshes and shows the new names.

### Find & replace in group names

- [ ] DCS-SMS → Mass Edit opens the window.
- [ ] Window title includes a `[loaded HH:MM:SS]` suffix (dev aid; remove when stable).
- [ ] The Group scope tab is active by default. The other four scope tabs (Unit, Waypoint, Zone, Drawing) are visible but render only a "No forms yet for this scope" label in the right pane when clicked.
- [ ] The left pane lists every group in the mission. Switching to a mission with several groups: the list populates with all of them. No dependency on the marquee tool.
- [ ] The name-filter EditBox above the list narrows it (case-insensitive substring match).
- [ ] Sort headers work — clicking Name / Country / Type / # Units sorts asc / desc.
- [ ] Checkboxes in column 0 toggle independently. Whole-row click also toggles.
- [ ] The right pane shows exactly one form: "Find & replace in group names".
- [ ] All widgets are skinned (visual match against Prefab Manager — same blue navy theme).
- [ ] Type `Foo` in Find, `Bar` in Replace. Check 2 groups whose names contain `Foo`. Click `Replace`. Names update to substitute Foo→Bar. Footer toast reads `2 renamed`.
- [ ] Groups whose names did NOT contain `Foo` remain unchanged.
- [ ] Press `Ctrl+Z` while the Mass Edit window has focus. The two renamed groups revert to their original names.
- [ ] Click `Refresh`. The list re-walks the mission; any external rename (e.g. via ME group panel) is picked up.

### Auto-name units

Single-button form. For each checked group, renames every unit to
`<groupname>-<idx>` (idx is the 1-based position in the group's
units array). Writes via `Mission.renameUnit` so DCS's per-unit
collision detection applies.

- [ ] The Auto-name units form sits directly under `Rename groups`
      in the Group scope's right pane (rename-the-group + sync-the-
      units is a natural one-two flow). It's a single `Auto name units`
      button that spans the full form width.
- [ ] Check a group named `Viper-1` with two oddly-named units. Click
      `Auto name units`. Units become `Viper-1-1` / `Viper-1-2`. Toast:
      `2 units renamed`.
- [ ] Click `Auto name units` with nothing checked. Toast: `Nothing
      selected`.
- [ ] Click `Auto name units` on a group whose units are ALREADY
      named correctly. Toast: `No changes` (warning); no mutation.
- [ ] Press `Ctrl+Z` after a successful auto-name. Every unit name
      is restored.
- [ ] Hover the button — tooltip explains the rename pattern.

### Set country

- [ ] The Set country form sits below Find & replace and above Visibility & control in the Group scope's right pane.
- [ ] The country dropdown lists every country present in the mission. Each entry is coalition-tinted (red, blue, or neutral). Countries that have no entities in the current mission are NOT listed.
- [ ] After picking a country, the closed dropdown shows the country name with the matching coalition tint — no blank closed display.
- [ ] Check 2 groups currently in USA. Pick `Russia` in the dropdown. Click `Set`. Both groups move to Russia and to the red coalition. Footer toast: `2 country set`.
- [ ] Click `Set` with nothing picked in the dropdown. Toast: `Pick a country` (warning).
- [ ] Click `Set` with nothing checked. Toast: `Nothing selected` (warning).
- [ ] Check a group currently in Russia. Pick `Russia`. Click `Set`. Toast: `Already in Russia` (info). No mutation.
- [ ] Check two groups, one in USA and one in Russia. Pick `Russia`. Click. Toast contains `1 country set` and `1 unchanged`.
- [ ] Ctrl+Z reverts the most recent country-change.

### Visibility & control (toggle_group_flags)

- [ ] The Visibility & control form is the bottom form in the Group scope's right pane (below Set country).
- [ ] Form shows six state buttons in 2 rows × 3 columns: `Hidden on map`, `Hidden on planner`, `Hidden on MFD` (top row); `Game Master Only`, `Uncontrolled`, `Late activation` (bottom row).
- [ ] LEAVE-state buttons render with neutral text; ON cycles to green text; OFF cycles to red text.
- [ ] All six buttons default to LEAVE state (suffix `—`) on first mount. All three states share the same `dtc_button` skin — only the label suffix changes.
- [ ] Click `Hidden on map —` once → label becomes `Hidden on map ON`. Click again → `Hidden on map OFF`. Click again → back to `—`.
- [ ] Click `Apply` with nothing checked in the left pane → toast `Nothing selected` (warning). No mutation.
- [ ] Click `Apply` with all six buttons at LEAVE → toast `Nothing to apply` (warning). No mutation.
- [ ] Check 2 plane groups. Set `Hidden on map` to ON. Click Apply. Both groups disappear from the map; their list-pane Type cell unchanged. Toast: `2 flag changes` (success).
- [ ] If a group's right-side panel was open when Apply ran, the panel's `HIDDEN ON MAP` checkbox now reflects the new state without needing to reselect the group.
- [ ] All six state buttons reset to LEAVE after the successful apply.
- [ ] Re-check the same 2 planes. Set `Hidden on map` to OFF. Click Apply. Map markers return.
- [ ] Check 1 plane + 1 vehicle. Set `Uncontrolled` to ON. Click Apply. Plane's `uncontrolled` flips on; vehicle untouched. Toast: `1 flag change · 1 not applicable`.
- [ ] Check 1 static group. Set `Hidden on map` to ON and `Uncontrolled` to ON. Click Apply. Static is hidden; `uncontrolled` skipped for it. Toast: `1 flag change · 1 not applicable`.
- [ ] Check 2 planes. Set `Late activation` and `Hidden on MFD` both to ON in the same form (don't apply between). Click Apply. Both fields flip on both planes. Toast: `4 flag changes`.
- [ ] Press Ctrl+Z after the previous step. All four mutations are reverted (both planes back to their pre-apply state on both fields). Toast: `Undo successful`.
- [ ] Save the .miz and reopen. The flag values persist in the saved file.
- [ ] `dcs-sms me group set-hidden-on-planner --name <plane> --hidden=true` (CLI sanity check): flag flips on the named plane.
- [ ] `dcs-sms me group set-hidden-on-mfd --name <plane> --hidden=true`: same.
- [ ] `dcs-sms me group set-uncontrollable --name <plane> --enabled=true`: GAME MASTER ONLY checkbox in the ME's right panel ticks on for that group.

### Entity list multi-select (shift-click + bulk buttons + scroll preserve)

These items cover the left-pane selection ergonomics; they apply to every scope tab (not just Group). Use a mission populated with >50 entities so scroll behavior is observable — `tools/cmd/dcs-sms/exec --target gui --file ...` with a bulk-create snippet works.

- [ ] Click any row's text cell (not the checkbox). Mirrors the vanilla ME Unit List: the row's group becomes the **single** map selection, the right-side **group properties panel opens** with that group's fields editable, and the F10 camera **pans** onto it (zoom is left untouched). The row's checkbox is **not** toggled — batch inclusion is via the checkbox column only. The clicked row also becomes the anchor for a follow-up shift-click.
- [ ] On Unit scope, clicking a unit row opens the panel with **that unit** active (not the group's first unit).
- [ ] Shift-click a row's text 10 rows below the anchor. The shift-click still range-fills the checkboxes (Explorer/GTK semantics) — the camera does NOT pan and the map selection is NOT replaced. Anchor is preserved across repeated shift-clicks.
- [ ] Click a row 30 rows below the anchor without holding shift. Camera pans there, that group becomes the map selection, and the new anchor is set. Shift-click 5 rows above → range-fill from the new anchor.
- [ ] Click a checkbox directly (not the row text). The row toggles and the anchor moves to that row. A follow-up shift-click on another row's text body extends from the just-clicked checkbox row.
- [ ] Type a name-substring filter that hides the current anchor. Shift-click extends only within the visible (filtered) rows, treating the off-screen anchor as missing → behaves like a plain click.
- [ ] `Select all` button checks every row passing the current name filter. Hidden (filter-excluded) rows are untouched.
- [ ] `Invert` button flips the checked state of every visible row. Hidden rows are untouched.
- [ ] `Clear` button wipes the scope's selection entirely (including any rows currently filtered out). The shift-click anchor is reset; the next click is a fresh anchor.
- [ ] Scroll to the bottom of a long list. Click a checkbox or row body. The list stays scrolled to roughly that position (within a row or two) — does NOT jump back to row 0.
- [ ] Switch scope tabs (Group → Unit → Group). The prior tab's tree widget is detached from the window — the new tab's grid is the only one rendered. Repeated switching across all 5 scope tabs should not visibly slow the window over a long session (no orphan-grid accumulation).

### Map selection sync (group scope)

The Group-scope bulk-button strip has two extra buttons — `From map`
(pull map selection into Mass Edit checkboxes) and `Highlight` (push
checked groups onto the map selection). Replace semantics in both
directions; group scope only.

- [ ] Open Mass Edit on Group tab. Select 3 groups on the map (marquee).
      Click `From map`. The same 3 groups are now checked in Mass Edit;
      toast reads `Fetched 3 groups from map`.
- [ ] **Static scope From map (0.25.1):** Switch to the Static tab. Marquee
      several static objects on the F10 map. Click `From map` — the same
      statics are now checked in the list; toast reads `Fetched N statics from
      map`. The cross-select (`Select units`/`Select group`) button is NOT
      shown on the Static scope (statics have no unit↔group split). Empty map
      selection → `Map selection empty`, existing checks unchanged.
- [ ] Uncheck one and check two different ones (now 4 checked). Click
      `Highlight`. The 4 checked groups are now marqueed on the map and the
      right-side group panel reflects the new selection; toast reads
      `Pushed 4 groups to map`.
- [ ] `From map` is shown on the **Group, Unit, and Static** scopes; on
      Waypoint / Zone / Drawing / Airbase it's hidden (only `Select all` /
      `Invert` / `Clear` remain). Switching back to Group/Unit/Static brings
      it back.
- [ ] With an empty map selection, click `From map`. Toast reads
      `Map selection empty`; the existing Mass Edit checkboxes are
      **unchanged** (no wipe).
- [ ] Select a group on the map, then in Mass Edit clear all
      checkboxes, then click `Highlight`. Toast reads
      `Nothing checked to push`; the map's existing selection is
      **unchanged** (no `unselectAll` call).
- [ ] Hot-reload via `dcs-sms.exe reload-me-mod` while the window is
      open. `From map` and `Highlight` still work.

### Add prefix to group names

Single-input form. Prepends the typed text to every checked group's
name. Writes through DCS's collision-safe rename path (`check_group_name`
auto-disambiguates duplicates with `-1` / `-2` suffixes). Per-form undo.

- [ ] Open Mass Edit on Group tab. Check 3 groups with distinct names
      (e.g. `Alpha`, `Bravo`, `Charlie`). In the `Add prefix to group
      names` form, type `BLUE-`. Click `Add` (prefix form). All 3 names become
      `BLUE-Alpha` / `BLUE-Bravo` / `BLUE-Charlie`. Toast reads
      `3 prefixed`.
- [ ] With two groups both named `Foo` checked, type `X-` and click
      `Add` (prefix form). The two names become `X-Foo` and `X-Foo-1` (DCS
      auto-disambiguation through `check_group_name`).
- [ ] With nothing checked, click `Add` (prefix form). Toast reads
      `Nothing selected`. No mutation.
- [ ] With groups checked but the text box empty, click `Add` (prefix form).
      Toast reads `Text is empty`. Names unchanged.
- [ ] After a successful prefix run, press `Ctrl+Z`. Every prior name
      is restored exactly (no residual `-1` suffixes leaking through
      the undo path).

### Add suffix to group names

Mirror of the prefix form — appends the typed text instead of
prepending. Same write path, same undo behaviour.

- [ ] Open Mass Edit on Group tab. Check 3 groups with distinct names
      (e.g. `Alpha`, `Bravo`, `Charlie`). In the `Add suffix to group
      names` form, type `-TEST`. Click `Add` (suffix form). All 3 names become
      `Alpha-TEST` / `Bravo-TEST` / `Charlie-TEST`. Toast reads
      `3 suffixed`.
- [ ] With two groups both named `Foo` checked, type `-DEL` and click
      `Add` (suffix form). The two names become `Foo-DEL` and `Foo-DEL-1`
      (DCS auto-disambiguation).
- [ ] With nothing checked, click `Add` (suffix form). Toast reads
      `Nothing selected`.
- [ ] With groups checked but the text box empty, click `Add` (suffix form).
      Toast reads `Suffix is empty`. Names unchanged.
- [ ] After a successful suffix run, press `Ctrl+Z`. Every prior name
      is restored exactly.
- [ ] Keep Num toggle (**ON by default**). With groups named `Viper-1`,
      `Hornet_2`, `Eagle` checked, type `Sfx` and click `Add` (suffix form).
      Names become `ViperSfx-1`, `HornetSfx_2`, `EagleSfx` (the toggle
      inserts the suffix BEFORE a trailing `-<digits>` or `_<digits>`
      block; falls back to plain append when no trailing number is
      present). Hovering the toggle shows a tooltip explaining the
      behavior.
- [ ] Toggle `Keep Num` OFF and rerun the same input on `Viper-1` →
      becomes `Viper-1Sfx` (plain append).

## Unit scope (v0.10.0+)

Open Mass Edit, switch to the **Unit** tab. Confirm the treeview shows
Name · Type · Category · Skill · Coalition · Group with Coalition column
tinted red/blue/neutral per the unit's group country.

### Form gating

- [ ] With zero units checked: all 9 forms in the right pane are grayed out
      (Apply buttons + inputs disabled).
- [ ] Check 1 tank: planes-only forms (Set onboard #, Set fuel %) and
      planes/helos forms (Set livery) gray out. Skill, rename forms,
      heading remain interactive.
- [ ] Check 1 plane: every form is interactive.
- [ ] Check 1 plane + 1 tank: planes-only / planes-helos forms stay
      interactive (the plane is applicable); on Apply, the tank is
      silently skipped and the toast shows "· 1 not applicable". Set
      livery additionally grays out whenever the checked planes/helos
      span more than one airframe type.

### Per-form happy path (one tap each)

- [ ] **Find & replace in unit names:** check 2+ units, Find="-1" Replace="-A" → names update; toast "2 renamed".
- [ ] **Add prefix:** check 2 units, Prefix="[P] " → names update; toast "2 renamed".
- [ ] **Add suffix:** check 2 units, Suffix="-Lead", Keep Num OFF → names get suffix appended.
- [ ] **Auto-name:** check 3 units, Base="Falcon" Start="5" → units become Falcon-5, Falcon-6, Falcon-7.
- [ ] **Set skill:** check 2 units, pick "Excellent" → skill changes; toast "2 skill set".
- [ ] **Set onboard #:** check 3 planes (only), Start="010" → 010 / 011 / 012; click Random → all change to distinct 3-digit numbers.
- [ ] **Set livery:** check 2 planes of same airframe, pick a livery → both planes update.
- [ ] **Set heading (absolute):** check 2 units, type 90 → both units face east; close + reopen ME unit panel to confirm.
- [ ] **Set heading (delta):** with the same selection, type 45 in Delta → both units now face 135°.
- [ ] **Set fuel %:** check a plane, type 50 → toast "1 fuel set". If "used current-fuel fallback" appears, max_fuel resolver didn't recognize the airframe (file a follow-up).

### Undo

For each form above: run the apply, hit Ctrl+Z (or whatever the ME's undo key is), verify the unit reverts. Single-slot undo: only the last apply is undoable (matches existing form behavior).

## v0.15.0 — waypoint task verbs (gh #69)

- [ ] **Add a Bombing waypoint task via `me waypoint add-task`.**
      Open a mission with any group. Run
      `dcs-sms me waypoint add-task --group-name "<G>" --index 1 --task Bombing altitude=1500 expend=All`.
      Confirm exit 0, the JSON return reports `slot = 1`, and the ME's
      route panel shows the Bombing task at waypoint 1. (Group-task
      gating is informational only — the verb no longer rejects
      wrong-main-task post-pivot.)

- [ ] **Add an EngageTargets enroute task to a CAP group.**
      Run `dcs-sms me waypoint add-enroute-task --group-name "<G>" --index 1 --task EngageTargets`.
      Confirm exit 0 and the task appears in the ME route panel under
      enroute tasks for the waypoint.

- [ ] **Kind-gating fail check.**
      Run `dcs-sms me waypoint add-task --group-name "<G>" --index 1 --task EngageTargets`.
      Confirm exit 1 with an error mentioning the task is an enroute task.

- [ ] **`remove-task --slot 99` rejects.**
      Confirm exit 1 with "slot out of range".

- [ ] **`clear-tasks` keeps enroute tasks.**
      Pre-add one waypoint and one enroute task. Run `clear-tasks`.
      Confirm only the waypoint kind was removed.

- [ ] **`list-tasks` returns sane sets.**
      Run `dcs-sms me waypoint list-tasks --group-name "<G>"` and confirm
      the JSON has non-empty `waypoint_tasks` / `enroute_tasks` arrays
      that match the group's main task.

- [ ] **`describe-task --task Bombing`.**
      Confirm fields include `weaponType`, `expend`, `altitude`, etc.

- [ ] **Round-trip save: write tasks, save .miz, reload, confirm tasks persist.**

## ME Hotkeys

- [ ] **DCS-SMS → Hotkeys** opens the window; an Action | Binding table groups
      actions under category rows (Map/Selection, Object-add, Panel).
- [ ] Click a category row → it collapses/expands (▶ / ▼ glyph); rebinding a row
      afterwards does NOT re-expand a collapsed category.
- [ ] Press each default key with no field focused → the matching action fires
      (e.g. `t` Triggers, `w` Weather, `d` Draw, `r` Ruler, `l` Unit List,
      `left` pans the map).
- [ ] Each main-menu category fires its entries (the `menuBar.<menu>.menu.<item>`
      paths are silent no-ops if mis-keyed, so verify per menu): **File** Save As
      `Ctrl+Shift+S` / Open Backup `Ctrl+Shift+O`; **Edit** Load/Save Static
      Template; **View** Beacons/Metric/Imperial/Icons; **Flight** Prepare
      `Ctrl+Shift+P` / Replay; **Campaign** Campaign/Builder; **Misc**
      Credits/Encyclopedia.
- [ ] Search box filters by name, category or key: `ctrl` narrows to Ctrl
      combos, `shift+s` finds Save As, `pan` the pan actions; matches inside a
      collapsed category still surface; `×` clears.
- [ ] **`+ New Script`** opens the editor. Enter a name, click **Run** on
      `return 1+1` → status shows `→ 2`. Capture a hotkey, **Save** → a row
      appears under the **Scripts** category with that key.
- [ ] Press the script's hotkey (no field focused) → the script runs (verify its
      effect, e.g. a `log.write` line in `dcs.log`).
- [ ] Double-click the script row → editor reopens pre-filled; edit the code,
      **Save** → behaviour updates.
- [ ] A script with a syntax error: **Save** is blocked and the error is shown;
      **Run** on broken Lua shows the error and does not crash the editor.
- [ ] **Delete** in the editor removes the row; the **Scripts** category
      disappears when the last script is gone.
- [ ] Restart the ME → scripts persist (reloaded from
      `<Saved Games>\DCS\dcs-sms\me_scripts.lua`).
- [ ] Dynamic Mission rows are greyed with `—`, can't be selected or bound.
- [ ] Open a unit name field and type a word containing `m` → it types normally
      (does NOT trigger Multi Select).
- [ ] Double-click a row, hold Shift and press a letter → it captures `Shift+…`
      (a modifier alone does NOT bind); the action turns amber italic (changed
      from default); category headers are bold, action rows sit indented.
- [ ] Re-assign a key already used by another row → it moves to the new row; the
      old row shows `(unbound)`.
- [ ] Select a modified row, click **↩ Reset selected** → it returns to its
      default and the amber italic clears.
- [ ] Click **Reset all** → every row returns to its default.
- [ ] Restart the ME → bindings persist (overrides reloaded from
      `<Saved Games>\DCS\dcs-sms\me_hotkeys.lua`).

## Community prefab library

> These require the LuaSec payload in `Saved Games/DCS/dcs-sms/lib/`. Without
> it, only the "degrades gracefully" checks apply.

- [ ] Open the Prefab Manager → a `[My Prefabs] [Community]` tab strip is visible; My Prefabs is selected by default and looks unchanged.
- [ ] Click **Community** the first time → it auto-syncs: status shows "Syncing…", then "Synced N prefabs." within a second or two, and the editor never freezes during the fetch (pan/zoom the map mid-sync to confirm).
- [ ] The list shows name / author / ♥ / theatre; selecting a row fills the detail panel (description, tags, counts).
- [ ] A thin vertical splitter handle sits in the gutter between the entry list (left) and the detail/description column (right). Click + drag it left → the description widens and the list shrinks; drag right → the reverse. Both panes clamp to a usable minimum. Releasing stops the drag, and resizing the whole window afterwards keeps the chosen split. Switching to My Prefabs and back hides/shows the handle with the rest of the tab (it never lingers over the My Prefabs panel).
- [ ] Type in the search box → list filters by name/author/tag live. Click a tag chip → list filters to that tag; click again → clears.
- [ ] Change sort (likes / name / newest) → order updates.
- [ ] Click **＋ Add to my library** → status confirms "Imported … → Community/"; switch to My Prefabs → a `Community` folder now holds the prefab; place it normally.
- [ ] Re-select the same community prefab → button shows **Imported ✓** (disabled).
- [ ] Click **⟳ Refresh** → re-fetches; "last synced" time updates.
- [ ] **Image previews (me-mod ≥ 0.25.0):** select a prefab that has screenshots (e.g. `snow-city`) → the WHOLE image appears on the right, below the description, scaled to fit the column (not a cropped corner). With >1 image, `◀ i / N ▶` shows and the arrows cycle (wrapping). Drag the splitter / resize the window → the image rescales and keeps its aspect ratio (no stretching). Select a prefab with no images → the panel collapses and the description fills the column. With `lib/` removed (no networking), selecting a prefab shows no image and does not error.
- [ ] **Enlarge window (me-mod ≥ 0.25.0):** click the thumbnail → a larger, resizable window opens showing the same image scaled to fit; resize it → the image re-fits (aspect preserved). Its `◀ ▶` cycle the images and stay in sync with the inline thumbnail's counter. Selecting a different prefab in the tab hides the window; switching to another tab (My Prefabs / Triggers) also closes it. Clicking the thumbnail again re-opens it.
- [ ] **No show-through on resize (regression, 0.25.1):** on the Community tab, select a prefab so its image preview (and, for a mod-dependent entry, the yellow missing-mod warning) is visible → switch to **My Prefabs** → **resize the window**. The Community image/warning must NOT appear over the My Prefabs page. Repeat ending on the **Triggers** tab (should also stay clean).
- [ ] **Degrades gracefully:** with the `lib/` payload removed, open Community → it shows the cached catalog (or empty) and Refresh reports "secure networking unavailable"; the rest of the Prefab Manager is unaffected.
- [ ] **CA bundle fallback (me-mod ≥ 0.27.4):** rename `Saved Games/DCS/dcs-sms/lib/cacert.pem` → Refresh still syncs (it falls back to the copy in `<DCS>/MissionEditor/modules/dcs_sms_me/cacert.pem`). Rename that one too → Refresh reports `CA bundle missing (dcs-sms\lib\cacert.pem) — re-run "dcs-sms install-me-mod"` (never `error loading CA locations ((null))`), `dcs.log` lists every path tried, and the editor stays responsive. Restore both → Refresh syncs again.
- [ ] **Tamper check (optional):** point `community_config.RAW_BASE` at a file whose bytes don't match its manifest sha256 → import is refused with a sha256-mismatch message; no file is written.
- [ ] Tab buttons don't visually collide with the SMSWindow title bar; the My-Prefabs panel looks identical to before (grid same size) and still works (place a prefab, rename, undo).
- [ ] The detail panel's multi-line text (name/author/tags/counts/description) renders on separate lines (not run together) — if this DCS build's Static ignores `\n`, note it.
- [ ] Tag chips render without overlap/clipping when there are many or long tags; after a Refresh, old chips don't leave ghosts.
- [ ] The "Imported ✓" state shows as disabled/non-actionable after importing (and re-importing the same prefab reports "Already imported." rather than duplicating).
- [ ] Community panel looks correct at the default window size AND after resizing the window (its layout is static/non-resize-aware — confirm acceptable).

## Prefab triggers (me-mod ≥ 0.22.0)

Setup: open a mission with ≥10 triggers incl. at least one zone-referencing
condition, one out-picture/out-sound action, one do-script.

- [ ] Triggers tab lists every trigger with correct C/A counts; filter works;
      shift-click range-fills checkboxes; detail pane shows resolved
      conditions/actions + portability section.
- [ ] Save 3 checked triggers → file appears in the library (T column = 3);
      file under Saved Games/dcs-sms/prefabs/<folder> parses (open in editor).
- [ ] Save a normal prefab whose selection is referenced by a trigger →
      bundle checklist appears pre-checked; saving with it stores triggers +
      embedded media in the .prefab.
- [ ] New mission → place that prefab → import dialog appears; bundled
      group/zone refs auto-bound (rename via Name/Prefix forms first to
      prove id-map rebinding survives renames); import → triggers appear at
      the end of the trigger list; out-picture works (media landed).
- [ ] Place a triggers-only prefab → no map click required; dialog appears
      immediately.
- [ ] A trigger referencing a group NOT in the prefab: manual-map dropdown
      binds it to an existing group; 'skip' on a sole action auto-unchecks
      the trigger with a reason.
- [ ] Flag overlap warning shows when target mission reuses a flag.
- [ ] Ctrl+Z after import removes placed entities AND imported triggers;
      trigger panel refreshes if open.
- [ ] Save the mission, reopen the .miz → imported triggers + media survived
      ED's save round-trip.
- [ ] **Lua Predicate condition (regression, 0.25.1):** import a trigger whose
      condition is a **Lua Predicate** (`X: LUA PREDICATE`, e.g. text
      `return true`). Save the mission, reopen → the predicate text is still
      there (NOT an empty box). Same check via the CLI:
      `dcs-sms me trigger add-condition --trigger <name> --predicate predicate
      text="return true"`, then save+reopen.

## Prefab mod dependencies (me-mod ≥ 0.23.0)

- [ ] Place a prefab whose required mod IS installed → no warning, places normally.
- [ ] Place a prefab whose required mod is NOT installed → "Missing mods" modal lists the mod + object count; "Cancel" aborts, "Place anyway" proceeds.
- [ ] Prefab Manager list shows a non-zero `M` count for a mod-dependent prefab.
- [ ] Community tab detail shows the "requires mods: …" line for an entry whose index.json carries required_modules.
- [ ] Community tab: select an entry needing a mod you DON'T have → a yellow "You don't have: …" line appears above the Add button naming it; an entry needing only mods you DO have → no yellow line (plain "requires mods" info line still shown); a mod-free entry → neither.

## Prefab Manager — save folder dialog (added 0.24.0)

- [ ] Highlight a subfolder in the Folder Browser, type a name, click **Save** → a "Save Prefab" dialog opens with that subfolder pre-selected. Click **Save** → file lands in that subfolder; status confirms the path.
- [ ] With nothing/root selected, click **Save** → dialog opens with **(root)** selected; **Save** writes to the prefabs root with no "pick a destination" warning.
- [ ] In the dialog, click **New Folder**, enter a name → the folder appears in the picker, selected; **Save** lands the prefab inside it.
- [ ] Click **New Folder**, create one, then click **Cancel** → no prefab is written, but the new folder persists (visible in the main browser after reload).
- [ ] Save a name that already exists in the chosen folder → Overwrite / Rename / Cancel prompt fires; the message names the chosen folder.
- [ ] Save the same name into a *different* folder than an existing one → no overwrite prompt (the check is folder-scoped); both files coexist.
- [ ] The `Community/` folder is absent from the dialog's picker (import-only).

## Trigger Finder

- [ ] DCS-SMS → Trigger Finder opens the window; the menu item toggles it closed/open.
- [ ] Single-click a unit on the map → the tree shows its group (expanded) and units; right pane header reads `Triggers referencing unit "<name>"`.
- [ ] Marquee-select several groups + a static → all appear; static is a leaf node; amber count badges on nodes with triggers, grey `0` otherwise.
- [ ] Select a trigger zone → it appears as a leaf node; clicking it lists the triggers that reference that zone (e.g. "in zone" conditions); clicking one jumps to it.
- [ ] Click a node with ≥1 trigger → one button per trigger (name + `type · source · predicate` sub-line).
- [ ] Click a trigger button → the vanilla trigger panel opens (if closed) and selects that trigger with its conditions/actions shown.
- [ ] Change the map selection while open → the tree auto-updates within a moment.
- [ ] Double-click a group row → its units collapse/expand.
- [ ] Drag the splitter → the tree pane resizes for long group names.

## Share to community (unreleased)

Needs `community_config.SUBMIT_URL` pointing at a deployed ingest worker (`tools/ingest-worker`).

- [ ] Right-click one of your own prefabs → **Share to community...** is listed; on a prefab inside `Community/` (downloaded) it is absent.
- [ ] The dialog opens centred over the Prefab Manager with Name prefilled; the Prefab Manager is disabled until the dialog closes.
- [ ] Take two screenshots (PrtSc), reopen the dialog → both are listed newest-first; **Screenshots folder** opens Explorer there.
- [ ] Submit with Author empty → "Author is required." in the footer; nothing is sent.
- [ ] Fill every field, tick one screenshot, **Submit** → footer counts up "Uploading… N%" then "Submitted for review"; the map stays pannable throughout; **Open PR** appears and opens the PR in the browser.
- [ ] The PR adds `prefabs/<slug>.prefab`, `<slug>.meta.json` and `images/<slug>/1.<ext>`, is labelled `community-submission`, and its `validate` check passes.
- [ ] Reopen the dialog → Author is remembered.
- [ ] First submission on a fresh install (no `Saved Games\DCS\dcs-sms\identity.json`): the dialog says a key is created on first submission; Submit shows "Creating your submitter key…" briefly without freezing the map; afterwards the dialog shows `Your submitter key: sms:…` and `identity.json` exists.
- [ ] The PR body shows the same `sms:…` fingerprint and "first submission from this key"; the sidecar has `submitter_key`. A second submission says "1 earlier submission(s)".
- [ ] **Show key file** opens Explorer with `identity.json` selected.
- [ ] Set the PC clock 10+ minutes off and Submit → the footer says the clock is off; no PR. Restore the clock.
- [ ] Submit the same prefab again while its PR is still open → "Already submitted and awaiting review: <PR link>"; no new PR. Close that PR, submit again → accepted.
- [ ] Submit a prefab whose PR was merged → "Already in the catalog as ..."; no new PR.
- [ ] Start an upload with several large screenshots and press **Stop** → "Upload stopped."; no PR is opened.
- [ ] Close the dialog mid-upload, then choose Share again → the running dialog comes back with its progress.
- [ ] With the Share dialog open, exit the Mission Editor to the main menu → the dialog hides along with the Prefab Manager; re-entering the ME shows neither.
- [ ] With `SUBMIT_URL` empty → Submit reports "Community uploads are not configured in this build."
